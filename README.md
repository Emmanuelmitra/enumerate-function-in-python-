Using the enumerate() Function
Instead of using the range() function, we can instead use the built-in enumerate() function in python. enumerate() allows us to iterate through a sequence but it keeps track of both the index and the element.
enumerate(iterable, start=0)
The enumerate() function takes in an iterable as an argument, such as a list, string, tuple, or dictionary. In addition, it can also take in an optional argument, start, which specifies the number we want the count to start at (the default is 0).
